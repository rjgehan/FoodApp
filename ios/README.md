# Meal Planner for iOS

A native client for the same backend the web app uses. No new API: it signs in with the PIN
flow, reads the plan, the groceries and the recipes, and ticks things off.

## Running it

Once, after installing Xcode:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

Then, with the dev backend up (`./dev.sh start` at the repo root):

```bash
cd ios
./preview.sh                  # build, boot a simulator, install, launch
./preview.sh --shot look.png  # ...and save a screenshot
```

Or open `MealPlanner.xcodeproj` in Xcode and press ⌘R.

## Looking at every screen

Two ways, both without a backend:

- **Xcode canvas** — every view file ends in a `#Preview`, so ⌥⌘↩ draws it from `SampleData`.
- **The Gallery tab** — a debug-only tab listing every screen, with a light/dark switch. It is
  the app's version of the screen-inventory PDF the web has. It never calls the network.

## Where the server is

`Config.baseURL`, default `http://localhost:8080`, which is what the simulator sees on this
Mac. Change it from the sign-in screen (Server, top right) — a phone on the house wifi needs
the LAN address, and off the network it needs `https://meals.gehan.cloud`.

`MealPlanner-Info.plist` allows plain http to local addresses only (`NSAllowsLocalNetworking`),
so the public host still has to be https.

## Layout

```
MealPlanner/
  MealPlannerApp.swift     the app, the tabs, Household
  Networking/              Models, APIClient, Session + Keychain
  Features/                SignIn, Plan, Groceries, Recipes
  Preview/                 SampleData and the Gallery
```

The project uses a synchronized folder group, so a new `.swift` file under `MealPlanner/` is
picked up with no project edit and nothing to merge.
